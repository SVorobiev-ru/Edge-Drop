/**
 * Versioned cache for the stick display's work area.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The cursor poll reads this cache ~60x/sec. Historically the cache was a
 * bare rectangle refreshed by (a) a fragile "equals exactly 1920x1080"
 * sentinel each tick and (b) OS display events - but NOT when the user
 * switched the stick display in Settings or the tray. Result: the window
 * moved to the new monitor while edge detection kept measuring against the
 * OLD monitor's origin, producing the classic report "hovering my second
 * screen does nothing; hovering the PRIMARY screen opens the panel on the
 * secondary".
 *
 * Contract of this cache:
 *  - Versioned by stick display id: `get(id)` rebuilds automatically when
 *    the value was built for a different id (fixes the stale-frame bug).
 *  - Last-known-good retention: a failed enumeration NEVER wipes a working
 *    rectangle (the poll keeps flying), but the failure is logged loudly
 *    instead of being swallowed.
 *  - Returns null only when no successful lookup has EVER happened.
 *  - O(1) per call; rebuilds happen only on identity change or explicit
 *    refresh() - zero recurring cost, zero retained growth.
